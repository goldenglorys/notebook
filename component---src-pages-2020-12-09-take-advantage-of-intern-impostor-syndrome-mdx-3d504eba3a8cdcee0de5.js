I was working primarily with someone I super looked up to & someone who’d just sold his startup to Dropbox. All my coworkers were incredibly smart & good at their jobs, & I was dropped into this company on a team of 4-5 where I had no idea how to use any of our (admittedly outdated) tools but presumed I was a genius who could solve it all. They were incredibly kind & mentored me—I ended up making some solid contributions by the end of the summer, but I was spectacularly unprepared for the job."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Learning how to use Rails 2.0 & edit a late-2000s codebase was actually probably my least important takeaway from that summer.

Coworkers are surely impressed with everything you can already do—many will probably be thrilled to work with you 1-on-1 a lot, so take advantage of that."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Listen, a lot, & seek out learning from folks at the company.
