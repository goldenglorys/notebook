SwiftUI will absolutely lower the barrier to entry, especially once Catalina is released & it’s natively easy to use. But so far nothing’s really worked for me.`}</p>\n    <p>{`One of the biggest barriers for me is needing to use a Mac—I have only opened my MacBook a few times in the past month, all to run the Arduino IDE for one of my classes.
