On a great page, the design is not just communicating the words, but is supporting them & speaking for itself. This is why CSS templates always end up feeling dull: the content has been fit into a templates set of boxes, instead of building unique boxes with shared characteristics around the content.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://centresustains.com/climate\"\n      }}>{`recent page explaining local climate change`}</a>{`, this especially came to fruition. I realized that even as someone who’s tried to research & understand climate change better than average, I couldn’t explain what was changing about climate in my own town. For most web projects, I need to deeply understand the topic before I can effectively communicate about it; for this project, I wanted to make the page partly to answer my own questions. I was working with `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-adams-0ba92611\"\n      }}>{`Pam Adams`}</a>{`, who provided all the research/knowledge & drafts of the writing. We went back-&-forth dozens of times, her writing a first draft of each section, my trying it out on the page & editing it down, her expanding with more information & wording.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While most local government communications end up obscured by bureaucratic language, we aimed for intense clarity & accessibility. As I designed the page, making the content & the design speak together was my greatest challenge. There’s lots of pages with charts of carbon dioxide or lists of effects of climate change; what’s rare is making them communicate something beautifully together.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://centresustains.com/climate\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"https://cloud-m5f0wwwog.vercel.app/2021-01-27_screen%20shot%202021-01-27%20at%2015.27.17.png\",\n          \"alt\": \"Screenshot of the Forests section of centresustains.com/climate\"\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`Making a template for this, interleaving icons with the text & highlighting part of the text like that wouldn’t have occured to me, because no words in “lorem ipsum” stand out to me.

Drop the lorem ipsum, get some real words in there—even if those words are a draft, you’ll be able to design with a new level of clarity, with much more interesting results.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
