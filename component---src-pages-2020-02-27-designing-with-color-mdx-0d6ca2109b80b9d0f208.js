Similar to fonts, the more colors you‚Äôre using, the harder it is to use them well. If you‚Äôre only using black and white, it‚Äôs hard to use them wrong‚Äîyou only have two options for each element, and one is already the background. If you add a cyan for accents, you can selectively pick a few elements (like buttons or links) to highlight.
