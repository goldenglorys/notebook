An online hackathon can be as simple as making a quick website, a Slack workspace, a Devpost, organizing 3 Zoom calls & calling it a day. While it’s great that more folks can start organizing, the much lower barrier to bringing a hackathon to fruition, without nearly the same challenges of sponsorship & logistics, means many are less inspired.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I think it’s also way clearer what components you really need to nail for a great in-person event—good food, which requires plenty of money, a nice space, diverse attendees, workshops, swag, judging, whatever. Online, it’s a lot less clear what to focus on, & how to make those areas great. How do you get people actually talking in a Slack, without people naturally talking to who’s next to them? How do you get them to walk away with real friendships? Those don’t have easy answers like “Panera catering.” (Which I highly recommend.)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Crucially, the best experiences in person (like eating ice cream with a stranger at 2am while helping each other with React.js) don’t always translate to the best experiences online. At the same time, the format for a truly compelling online event isn’t super figured out, much less standardized. We’re certainly learning that at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://hackclub.com/\"\n      }}>{`Hack Club`}</a>{`—`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/\"\n      }}>{`Scrapbook`}</a>{` has been way more successful than a hackathon we could’ve run, while in-person it wouldn’t even make sense.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We’ll see where the space goes, but I think the only way forward is iteration. We need lots of events to try lots of experiments on what works amazingly online, instead of trying to directly upload a uniquely physical experience to the internet. Some components will fail, others will start to become normalized. But hackathons can be magical, life-shaping experiences—let’s figure out how to bring that ✨ onto the internet.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
