An online hackathon can be as simple as making a quick website, a Slack workspace, a Devpost, organizing 3 Zoom calls & calling it a day. While it’s great that more folks can start organizing, the much lower barrier to bringing a hackathon to fruition, without nearly the same challenges of sponsorship & logistics, means many are less inspired."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I think it’s also way clearer what components you really need to nail for a great in-person event—good food, which requires plenty of money, a nice space, diverse attendees, workshops, swag, judging, whatever. Online, it’s a lot less clear what to focus on, & how to make those areas great. How do you get people actually talking in a Slack, without people naturally talking to who’s next to them? How do you get them to walk away with real friendships?
