(Does that mean a photographer?)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Break down the event into 15-minute chunks & run through the entire schedule, maybe multiple times, with your whole team, listing all the required preparation for each piece of the event. You’ll be shocked how many little things come up. I highly recommend assigning 1-2 organizers to run each part of the event, especially bigger aspects like meals & judging. This way you can balance out work across the team, give organizers breaks (especially for sleeping), & make sure there’s someone in charge of what’s happening at every point in the event.
