Personally, I found the online courses this spring pretty wholly disappointing & I didn’t feel like I left them having learned much of anything or having derived real value. While of course it caught us off guard this spring, I didn’t see the university helping professors to make their online classes excel, & the results I found disengaging at best. It also…still cost full shot ($80k)…and will this fall.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Attend via `}<a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.nyu.edu/academics/studying-abroad/go-local.html\"\n        }}>{`Go Local`}</a>{`. Seems to entail everything bad about living in a city, everything bad about taking classes remotely, none of the IMA people/facilities to benefit from, plus living in an expensive city I don’t really want to live in. Makes sense if you don’t live close to NYC, but that’s not me.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Take just a few credits/take the spread-out option. Reduces my motivation/ability to fully commit to my academics (already a primary concern of remote) by it not being full-time, if just a few credits then not getting financial aid if I’m not a full student, while also restricting me from having a full-time job outside of classes.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Come to the city. NYU’s communications thus far have been pretty non-informative, but none have addressed my primary concerns (transit/taking the subway, dining halls, what restricted social life will look like/do to my mental health), and even in the best-case scenario, I’m not hanging out with friends & building projects on the IMA floor, which are some of the main things I came to college for, or really exploring & enjoying the city.`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`Unfortunately, if it still costs the same but provides maybe a quarter of the value while also featuring the choice between living at home or risking my health in NYC, it just doesn’t make sense for me. (The alternative, working, I can do safely wherever & comes with a paycheck, so…that’s what I’m doing. I’ve re-joined `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://hackclub.com/\"\n      }}>{`Hack Club`}</a>{` & I’ve been having a blast designing & coding & building our community.)  `}</p>\n    <p>{`My professors at NYU were fantastic, and made `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://itp.nyu.edu/ima/\"\n      }}>{`IMA`}</a>{` a joy to be apart of. This is not a turn I anticipated in my college career, & I really hope I can return when it makes sense, as I will miss the environment at NYU/IMA greatly. But in the meantime, if I can work remotely, not get COVID, earn my tuition in salary, and have an exciting, productive year, the choice seems clear.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
