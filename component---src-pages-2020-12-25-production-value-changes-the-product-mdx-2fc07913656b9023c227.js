For him, it wasn’t merely a personal/business move, but also a business one—his Patreon charged patrons only when he released a video, so he hesitated to release anything smaller than what’s come before for fear of disappointing them.

You don’t buy lights & cameras or do animation, write scripts, record takes, edit & export & publish a complex video as a note to yourself.
