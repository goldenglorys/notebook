He mentioned he wanted to hire me to make a new website for Hack Club, an offer I was humbled & surprised by but took him up on soon after hackathon-recovery. We spent the rest of the fall on frequent calls working on drafts of a newÂ hackclub.com (`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20171221102322/https://hackclub.com/\"\n      }}>{`https://web.archive.org/web/20171221102322/https://hackclub.com/`}</a>{`), which pushed my skills hard.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Over the last 3 years, Iâ€™ve worked on our website, designed several generations of Bank, made Scrapbook, the Hackathons site, Workshops site & curriculum, Events site, the Summer of Making, designed stickers, co-authored every VIP newsletter, made Hack Club Design System, Theme, Icons, branding, open source projects, AMAs, Challenge, holiday gifts, Shop, donor materials, a Flagship talk, Leaders, student announcements, social media, iPad distribution, run events, hackathons, Slack sub-communities, & lots more I canâ€™t remember anymore. Iâ€™ve poured my heart & soul into Hack Club, & I feel deeply proud of what Iâ€™ve gotten to help build. Itâ€™s been a privilege to travel to San Francisco, LA, Chicago, NYC, Vermont, Indiana, & spend so much time with every member of the incredible team. Hack Clubâ€™s missionâ€”helping young people discover their agency & build skillsâ€”is the cause I believe in the most. In the Slack, Iâ€™ve found many of my closest friends.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Tomorrow is my last day at Hack Club HQ, Iâ€™m sad to announce. Iâ€™ve been working on Hack Club for 3 years, & itâ€™s the only real job Iâ€™ve ever had. My next adventures are super WIP, but for a lot of reasons it feels right to take a new step. Iâ€™ll still be around the Slack, & here to chat with anyone. Thank you all for making this place so incredible, & to Zach & the team for this opportunity. Keep hackingÂ ðŸ’–`}</p>\n    <p>{`â€”@lachlanjc`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
