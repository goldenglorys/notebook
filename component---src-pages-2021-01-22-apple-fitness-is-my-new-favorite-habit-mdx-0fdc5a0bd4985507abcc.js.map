<p>{`After mixed experiences with Apple’s various services, I didn’t have high hopes for Apple Fitness+. But since it launched in early December, I’ve done several dozen workouts on Fitness+, several days every week. It’s surprisingly great.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I’ve been wearing an Apple Watch every day since it launched in 2015. Right at the beginning, I was committed to closing all my rings every day, but like most people, that eventually faded. I did make real efforts to close my rings, with oscillating levels of interest throughout my last few years. Overall, my Apple Watch has consistently encouraged me to do more activity & exercise than I would without one, though.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you want to be more aware of your fitness & health, I do truly recommend the Apple Watch. Being aware of how much I sleep (I used `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111?uo=4\"\n      }}>{`AutoSleep`}</a>{` for a long time, but switched to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.macstories.net/stories/sleep-tracking-in-watchos-7-and-ios-14-elevated-by-a-user-experience-driven-design/\"\n      }}>{`Apple’s built-in tracking`}</a>{` with watchOS 7), washing my hands more & for longer than I used to, standing up every hour (it’s `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://twitter.com/seldo/status/1350556471856041985?s=20\"\n      }}>{`remarkably easy`}</a>{` not to), being aware of my resting heart rate—I don’t believe in carefully tracking & optimizing all the numbers of your health, but having a sense of where you are & your general trends I’ve found incredibly helpful for keeping myself healthier.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`One quick aside. The Stand ring monitoring is just not very good. While the handwashing & noise detection & the other, newer passive awareness features I’ve found fairly reliable, the Stand ring is anything but. I can walk around for multiple minutes & not get credit, or dangle my wrist from the couch just right & be rewarded for my standing. I also wear my Watch at night, which necessitates charging it before or after sleep, which loses me an hour of tracking there. I turned the ring to 10 hours from the default 12 a few months ago (scroll to the end of the Activity app for this control), & I’m glad for the reduced stress in my life.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`In mid-December, I realized I’d never had a month where I closed even just my Move ring every day, much less all of them. It’s been about a month now of closing every ring every day:`}</p>\n    <img alt=\"Screenshot of month of perfect rings\" src=\"https://cloud-hjc260tgy.vercel.app/2021-01-22_888cnnm20j36hvhuujztjbx2xbwycvtn.jpeg\" style={{\n      display: 'block',\n      margin: 'auto',\n      maxHeight: 384\n    }} />\n    <p>{`So fast-forward to Apple Fitness+. It has truly pleasantly surprised me: the trainers are diverse & a lot of fun, & I haven’t had negative experiences with any.\nThe workouts are varied, accessible but fairly consistent in difficulty.`}</p>\n    <p>{`My favorite way to use Fitness+ by far is the Apple TV. You can also download the Fitness app on your iPad or use it on the iPhone, but I find the small screen much harder to follow & feels more like watching a YouTube video than joining a group of trainers. Connecting AirPods to the Apple TV is seamless: taking an AirPod out pauses the video & the workout immediately, so you can grab a drink of water without missing a second.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\"><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1349485020658937857?s=21\"\n        }}><strong parentName=\"a\">{`Jordan Singer`}</strong>{` on Twitter:`}</a></p>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Apple Fitness+ is such a great example of the Apple ecosystem working together and the dots connecting looking backwards.`}</p>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Health + Apple Music + Apple Watch & iPhone/iPad/TV`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`While you’re doing a workout, the live metrics from your Apple Watch, as well as your Activity rings, appear onscreen.

While digital workout videos are nothing new, I’ve never been compelled to wade very far into trying to find reliable trainers online, & I never stuck with anything.
