Which is understandable—the price of an object is a huge part of a product’s identity & marketing, especially a new, high-profile product. $550 is certainly expensive for consumer headphones; while audiophile headphones can be several times that price, they aren’t marketing to the majority.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Most of the discussion at the launch of AirPods Max seemed to utterly miss the point, I believe. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://atp.fm/408\"\n      }}>{`ATP`}</a>{` & `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features\"\n      }}>{`The Verge`}</a>{` publish a lot of great work, but the reality is, high-end, wired audio customers aren’t coming to Apple’s AirPods brand for headphones. There’s cheaper, more sound-accurate wired headphones out there than what Apple is making.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To me, the most standout feature of the AirPods Max is the striking design. One size & 5 colors is perfectly Apple for a design accessory—a little bit of choice, but entirely within Apple’s palette. They look simultaneously retro & futuristic, utterly simple but meticulously refined. Regardless of people’s many opinions, the headband & case look like nothing else on the market.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Apple’s `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.macworld.com/article/3600247/3-rules-to-understand-the-price-of-apple-products.html\"\n      }}>{`pricing`}</a>{` is never the budget leader. It’s a huge part of the identity of the MacBook that they’re amazing computers nearly every well-known creative person owns, as well as that they start at $999. That AirPods start at $159 (which was much-decried upon release, but now totally normal) is very much `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20can%20t%20hear%20broke\"\n      }}>{`part of their identity`}</a>{` as well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`AirPods Max were always going to be high-priced, just for the features they offer—no other headphones, due to Apple’s strategic choices, have the H1 chips with seamless pairing & device switching. Just having the Apple brand (even if `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://twitter.com/vladsavov/status/1348827785943347202?s=20\"\n      }}>{`no logo`}</a>{`) is worth a premium.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But by producing a one-of-a-kind design (which reportedly `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/09/airpods-max-development/\"\n      }}>{`took 4 years`}</a>{`) & pricing them at $550, Apple made clear that they’re personal technology `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DLNqACv9Ug\"\n      }}>{`doubling as a fashion accessory`}</a>{`. Interestingly, it’s arguably Apple’s own Beats, a direct competitor in some ways, that started that trend in the early 2010s.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As a human on a global scale, I’m very well-off, though not always compared to many of my NYU classmates/friends. I take real pride in my appearance, & my style is very important to me, though most of my clothes are under $25 from H&M & I don’t own anything designer.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When it comes to headphones though, I would gladly sacrifice audio quality for style, & price for style. I simply have no interest in covering my head with black plastic. The Sony & Bose competitors AirPods Max have primarily been compared to are ugly & made of cheap-looking plastic, versus AirPods Max’s unibody aluminum, shiny stainless steel, & knit headband. The Digital Crown with a glass inlay is aesthetically (as well as an input mechanism) so preferable to an awkardly-placed USB-C port `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3\"\n      }}>{`hanging out`}</a>{`. (This absolutely makes me sound like `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2019-09-10_why_i_care_about_apple/\"\n      }}>{`an Apple fangirl`}</a>{` & general snob, but hey, we all prioritize differently.)`}</p>\n    <p>{`AirPods Max are priced perfectly: the price says that they’re undoubtedly luxury tech, as well as exceeding the value they have as a technological accessory by becoming a fashion accessory in a way that “WH-1000XM4” inarguably is not. I can’t wait to try some out.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
