A website I developed in Gatsby even a year ago is majorly out of date now—packages need to be updated, APIs have been deprecated, everything is dusty. Setting up a CMS requires choosing between a variety of services and their respective, often-unreliable community plugins. Last I used them, Gatsby Themes are unreliable, sparse, and poorly-documented. I’ll need to make them an account at a domain registrar, a hosting service, hook those things up, maybe a GitHub too. In two years, most parts of this system will probably have completely changed."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"I don’t know if no-code tools are even the dream here.

It’s hard to see that changing significantly soon."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Everyone I’ve made a Squarespace site for—even with the tool’s fairly constrained capabilities and tutorials—finds even that level of control of a website intimidating, and they rarely ever edit the sites without me. The promise of learning to code through a community like ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://glitch.com"},"Glitch")," is nice, but few have the time or commitment for that.
