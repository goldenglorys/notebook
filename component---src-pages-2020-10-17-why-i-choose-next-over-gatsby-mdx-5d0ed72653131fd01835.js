This is the most brilliant part of Next, & the feature Scrapbook’s site runs on, as well as tons of other Hack Club sites. Essentially, on build the page will run a function to prepare props that are passed to the page. I find this so, so, so much easier than using a component or Hooks to write a GraphQL query to get stuff out of Gatsby, & it’s way more flexible. Going alongside this, you can give getStaticProps a revalidate option, which means if it’s been that number of seconds since the page was last loaded, it should re-run the getStaticProps function to regenerate the page—in the meantime, it’s still serving the static page from cache, but then hot-updates that single page so future loads get the new data. This is a serverless operation that happens basically instantly, silently, & makes individual pages always up-to-date with new data without re-building the entire site for one bit of functionality.

In that config file, we also queried the years the events were in, looped through them, then rendered a year page template for each, & that page then queried all the hackathons filtering by the year provided by the template rendering.
