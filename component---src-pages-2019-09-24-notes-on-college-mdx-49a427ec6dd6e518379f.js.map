I have ideas of things to make on a daily basis, but now have no time to actually create them, and frankly I’m the least busy I’ll be during all four years of this. How am I supposed to do this for four years, working for companies in the summers, & `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`not`}</em>{` go do my own thing? As interesting as my classes are, not being able to create things directly from my soul is `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`stifling`}</em>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I do know incredibly smart college students who barely focus on the schoolwork & instead focus entirely on making things/developing outside school, & I really respect that. But personally, it just doesn’t make sense. I’m not going to college to please other people, I’m going because I think it makes sense for my life right now. There is no reason to spend many hours & a quarter million on an education you don’t focus on.`}</p>\n    <p>{`That said, this schedule was clearly optimized for those of us who want to put 100% into our academics & nothing else. Though academic work has significant merits, I cannot subsist merely off academic work. I need to truly engage in things I truly love, very directly, very frequently. I’ve been doing that since before I was a toddler—making “art” projects, knitting, coding, organizing—& I cannot stop now.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This was my bedroom as a young child:`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"https://cdn.glitch.com/a9442788-bc48-44ab-bedd-832d738c93dd%2Fcang10_01_2712_800p.jpg?v=1569353404918\",\n        \"alt\": \"My room as a young child\"\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`I am sure finding a balance here is the key. I have intentions to start a club here at NYU, build various new projects, excel in my classes, take great care of my health, have a flourishing social life & career. It’s easy to get carried away in the vision of each of these pathways, but ultimately it’s the balance of all the elements that will lead to a happy/successful time here.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
