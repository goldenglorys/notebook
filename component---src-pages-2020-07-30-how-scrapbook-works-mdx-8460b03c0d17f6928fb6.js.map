Essentially: decentralized, easy to spin up or down, based on Next.js + Airtable. Looking back at building Scrapbook, it feels like a real validation of this philosophy.

At the same time, while we’re not shutting it down, if we wanted to, we could turn off the Scrappy bot & walk away.

In a hasty technical transition, we migrated the functions into their own codebase, which is still a Next.js app but `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server\"\n      }}>{`using a custom server`}</a>{`, hosted on Heroku.

It stores no data itself and handles very little state.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Data fetching`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The most interesting part of this story is data fetching, on both the backend and frontend. Every page on the site uses Next’s `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation\"\n      }}><inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`getStaticProps`}</inlineCode></a>{` feature, which means you’re always getting a static page served to you from Vercel’s CDN, for every user.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The data used for every page is accessible over an API, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/about\"\n      }}>{`documented here`}</a>{`, which runs on Next’s API Routes with `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes\"\n      }}>{`dynamic routing`}</a>{`. (The API itself is merely a wrapper around Airbridge, making specific requests & restructuring the data in a consistent schema instead of the raw Airtable fields.) Because API Routes are merely functions, their functionality can be imported like any other JavaScript function. So each frontend page imports the function that powers its API counterpart, running it at build. It gives Next a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`revalidate: x`}</inlineCode>{` option, which means it will generate statically at build time, but whenever that page gets hit, if it’s been more than x seconds, it will regenerate that page in the background and update its cache, but always serve the static page.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To further speed up the app, we don’t pre-render all pages on the site at build, or it’d take several minutes to build, which slows down the app. We pre-render only the top 75 most active users (by querying Airbridge for them), and the emoji reactions that are linked to on the homepage.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For pages not pre-rendered, such as when a new user starts using Scrapbook or a new emoji is added, we enabled the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`fallback: true`}</inlineCode>{` option of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation\"\n      }}><inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`getStaticPaths`}</inlineCode></a>{`. When a path is visited for a user profile not yet rendered, it on-the-fly queries Airbridge & renders the profile page & caches it before serving to you. If you’ve seen “Loading…” on a profile page, the backend was generating a page for the profile & caching it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`On the frontend, you want to see posts in real-time as they’re added to Scrapbook, without reloading the page. For this, we use `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://swr.vercel.app\"\n      }}>{`SWR`}</a>{`, Vercel’s data fetching library. It polls the API endpoint for the page, on most pages using the same `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/hackclub/summer-scrapbook/blob/main/components/feed.js\"\n      }}>{`Feed component`}</a>{`, which handles fetching the data every few seconds. The data is cached on the frontend. If the network disconnects, there’s data cached, so we can keep showing it, & SWR will retry fetching at exponentially slower intervals. If it reconnects, no page reload is needed, it can download new data, re-render, and cache it on the frontend for the future. This is all the built-in behavior of SWR, nothing custom, which is wild.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To summarize: The page you’re served initially is static-rendered with all the data, & pretty much up-to-date, so you’re getting an instant response cached on a CDN. The component tree renders with the initial data passed down as props. Then SWR caches it on the frontend for good measure. Every few seconds, SWR refetches the data from an API function, which is the same function that ran at page build, to re-render on the client side. All of the pages of Scrapbook work like this.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Images & video`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Images I think are still not an ideal experience on Scrapbook, but making them load quickly & fluidly was critical. After several packages & different techniques over time, I settled on rolling `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/hackclub/summer-scrapbook/blob/main/components/image.js\"\n      }}>{`my own component`}</a>{`, inspired by this `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/okbel/next-store/blob/master/components/core/Image.js\"\n      }}>{`example project’s`}</a>{`, using intersection observers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Video, somehow, was far simpler to integrate thanks to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://mux.com\"\n      }}>{`Mux Video`}</a>{`. Serving video files directly from Airtable initially was super slow to load, so we instead upload videos directly to Mux on the backend, and they essentially livestream the footage directly into the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<video>`}</inlineCode>{` tag, without any proprietary libraries. On the frontend, using `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mux-video\"\n      }}>{`their Next.js example`}</a>{`, I made `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/hackclub/summer-scrapbook/blob/main/components/video.js\"\n      }}>{`a component`}</a>{` with live thumbnails that plays videos on hover. Mux even `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://mux.com/case-studies/hackclub/\"\n      }}>{`wrote a case study`}</a>{` about the integration with Scrapbook! Highly recommend Mux for a video-intensive project, especially with user-uploaded content.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`CSS`}</h3>\n    <p>{`CSS was an interesting part of this. Most of Hack Club’s websites use `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://theme-ui.com\"\n      }}>{`Theme UI`}</a>{` & the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://theme.hackclub.com\"\n      }}>{`Hack Club Theme`}</a>{`, and our early prototype did. But to make `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/customizer\"\n      }}>{`CSS customization`}</a>{` easy for beginners meant the HTML on profile pages had to be super readable, and Theme UI/Emotion creates randomly-named classes. So I `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/hackclub/summer-scrapbook/commit/7e2086303983acd949c7aa6170304ff9ea220767\"\n      }}>{`switched`}</a>{` to using an `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support\"\n      }}>{`app-wide imported stylesheet`}</a>{` for the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/hackclub/summer-scrapbook/blob/main/public/themes/default.css\"\n      }}>{`basic theme`}</a>{`, which worked seamlessly. For custom themes, it’s super simple—we add a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<link>`}</inlineCode>{` tag pointed to your CSS file. On pages that don’t allow customization, I lightly use `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx\"\n      }}>{`styled-jsx`}</a>{`. To share colors & fonts between the stylesheet, styled-jsx, & custom theme files, we use `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables\"\n      }}>{`CSS Custom Properties`}</a>{`.
