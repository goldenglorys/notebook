One of the great things about building a website is, you don’t have to install anything or become familiar with a terminal, & as soon as you write text, you see it on the screen. More broadly, you’re making something everyone has used before, so it breaks down an existing barrier—Facebook & Reddit & Gmail are all written using these exact same technologies, writing these same tags, whereas even if a program is doing something cool, it’s to hard to relate to it since it’s locked inside a terminal."),(0,n.kt)("h2",null,"Structure"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"I super recommend running Hack Club’s Personal Website workshop.
