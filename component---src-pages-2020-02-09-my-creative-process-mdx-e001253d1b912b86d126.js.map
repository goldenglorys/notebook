Writing, I’ll try taking a piece in various different directions, eventually cutting tangents and streamlining and editing into something somewhat unified. Sketching a logo, I’ll try out dozens of small directions, highlight a few I like, keep iterating on those, eventually converging on one refined sketch. Coding, I’ll explore different ways of solving a problem, then eventually delete what I don’t need and streamline it into the best solution. I’d imagine it applies to other arts as well: in music production, trying various sounds that go a little too far, then cutting back to what feels right, or a similar process while editing video.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`(According, coincidentally, to the computer screen of my neighbor at the library, divergence & convergence is a `}<a parentName=\"em\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/ConvergenceOfSeries.aspx\"\n        }}>{`calculus concept`}</a>{` as well.

Everything kind of sits in my brain over the course of a few days, weeks, or months, with variable levels of intensity. At first, the divergences are tiny, happening subconsciously & in the background. When I sit down with an idea, they become much larger. Over time, developing ideas and working on projects, more divergence happens as I explore the scope & initial development. Then, through the final stretches of working on a project, everything converges, & I eventually arrive at a final product I’m happy with. My creative process is incredibly nonlinear—things can look incredibly unfinished until very close to the end—but it’s how I work.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`(Cross-posted from `}<a parentName=\"em\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://ima.lachlanjc.me/2020-02-09_bit_week_2_creative_process/\"\n        }}>{`my IMA blog`}</a>{`.)`}</em></p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
